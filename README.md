# Python-Live-Project
During a two-week Sprint with The Tech Academy I participated in a Live Project where I built a Django-based web application alongside a team of developers.  We each created our own application that could be navigated to from the main home page.  I used the following technologies:  Django, PyCharm, Azure DevOps, and Git.  The goal of my app was to create a database that would give dog owners a place to find similar dogs to play with.  Below are code snippets and screenshots from my PupApp application.    

There is a place for the owner to register themselves and for them to add their pup to the database.

Here is the code:

Here's what it looks like.
